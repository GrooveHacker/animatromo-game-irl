# Five Nights at Freddy's IRL

This is a fan-made version of Five Nights at Freddy's in real life with you as the guard and your friends as the animatronics.

In this version of the game, you (the "guard") have broken into a secure facility to hack into a computer and exfiltrate data. Having tripped the facility's security system, the "animatronics" guarding the facility are now loose and coming to find you. You must hack into the computer and exfiltrate the data before you are caught.
